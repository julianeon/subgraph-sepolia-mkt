# About

I deployed a test contract on Ethereum's Sebolia testnet and then deployed a subgraph to track it.

This is the talk I followed explaining the steps.

This is the smart contract address of my ERC721 token called MKT on the Sebolia testnet, which was indexed and is now queryable, thanks to the Graph.

After minting 2 test transactions from Remix's IDE, I confirmed those transactions then showed up in GraphQL subgraph explorer.
